# Be-A-Hope: Blockchain based fundraising platform

### What it does:

Be A Hope is a crowdfunding platform that helps poor people to raise funds for their needs like education, accommodation, medical expenses, and much more. Be A Hope platform utilizes the Tezos blockchain in the backend to handle all types of transactions providing which are currently deployed on Ithacanet. The main features which we provide are: the security of funds, authenticity of the users. transparency in transactions and open book accounting which means any donor can see how their funds are used.

Features we provide:

- Any person who is willing to donate can donate funds (in form of Tez) to their choice of fundraising projects
- Any NGO or Government registered organization can raise funds for needy people where they have to set goal amount which they want to raise with proper description and end time for the project.
- Claim funds button will be enabled if goal amount is reached till the end date. Once user click on claim funds, all funds (i.e. Tez) will be transferred to the owner of the project.

### The problem it solves:

There are some cases in which the centralized agency has control over the money donated by the donors. This money is sometimes used for their agency's own personal gain and hence the both the donors and the receivers are scammed. 

Thus this decentralized platform solves problem related to this topic

- Here the donor him/herself has total control over the money.
- There is no doubt among the donors as their money is put to good use.
- There is total transparency in this system. This feature can be used to see where the money is used.
- User privacy and trust is established on this decentralized platform.

### Challenges we ran into :

- It was quite a difficult task to build a DApp on the Tezos blockchain with the help of the SmartPy library in python as this was the first time we have written a smart contract for DApp.
- It was a challenging task to write a smart contract for crowdfunding from scratch as we need to understand the SmartPy library from the basic to the advance concepts.
- At first we had trouble adding authentication using Auth0 in the DApp as a functionality but in the end our team members with their problem solving skills to the rescue were able to overcome it.

### What we learnt :

- We have gained knowledge on how to make Decentralized Applications on top of the Tezos blockchain.
- We learnt how to create smart contracts using Smartpy and deploy it using Smartpy.io.
- We have learnt how to interact with smart contracts using typescript library i.e. Taquito.
- We have learnt how to integrate Auth0 for authentication.
- We also learnt how to work together as a team and our teamwork capabilities and the responsibilities we take.

### Technologies used :

The technologies used for making this Crowdfunding DApp on Tezos blockchain are :

Tezos Blockchain, Twilio,  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Smartpy library (Python), Github (VCS).
